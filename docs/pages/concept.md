# About the concept

It's a lego based concept.  
Means you can add or exchange parts of it (bricks).

This project comes with 2 parts:
* Build-Service ‚Üí [OBI](#object-builder-for-i-obi)  
  https://github.com/andreas-prouza/obi
* IDE integration ‚Üí [IBM i build with OBI](#ide-integration-ibm-i-build-with-obi)  
  https://github.com/andreas-prouza/ibm-i-build-obi

üìù Notice:  
Here I'm using git.  
Since it's a lego based concept, git is recommended but not necessary to use.


## Object Builder for i (OBI)

This is a backend processing tool.  
It can be used to execute several tasks:  
* generates the compile list
* runs the build
* creates a summary report

This tool needs to be installed on you IBM i to run the build commands. (2nd part in the picture above.)

For the first part (get compile list) [OBI](https://github.com/andreas-prouza/obi) can also be located on your PC.  
In my first project I used [OBI](https://github.com/andreas-prouza/obi) ony on IBM i.  
Unfortunately IBM i is not optimized for many IFS processing. So it can slow down this task if the machine weak.  
Fortunately it doesn't matter on which system [OBI](https://github.com/andreas-prouza/obi) is running for the first part.  
This results in great performance. Specially if your IBM i is not that fast.  


[OBI](https://github.com/andreas-prouza/obi) is supposed to be independed by any project.  
Means you can reuse the single [OBI](https://github.com/andreas-prouza/obi) setup for different projects.  
All configurations are located directly in each project like [etc/app-config.toml](/docs/pages/configuration.md#etcapp-configtoml) which is located in your project directory.


## IDE integration (IBM i Build with OBI)

This is the "cockpit".  
It manages the communication between OBI and your IDE

Every task will be done by a bash script (located in ```scripts/```).  
If you choose an IDE you need to find a way to easily execute them.

* In RDi  
  You can define the scripts in ```External Tools```  
  ![RDi](/docs/img/rdi-actions.png)
* In VSCode  
  You can use plugins to get them executed (e.g. ```Action Buttons```)
  ![vscode-buttons](/docs/img/vscode-actions.png)

Your sources are located here in ```src/```.

It also provides necessary configurations to OBI for building process.  
(```etc/app-config.toml```, ```etc/dependency.toml```, ...)

## The process step by step

![source-list](/docs/img/obi-steps.png)

1. [OBI](https://github.com/andreas-prouza/obi) is looking for changed sources  
   The source hash value will be compared with the value stored (from last build) in ```etc/object-builds.toml```
2. [OBI](https://github.com/andreas-prouza/obi) generates a compile list (```build-output/compile-list.json```)
3. [IBM i Build with OBI](https://github.com/andreas-prouza/ibm-i-build-obi) synchronise all sources to IBM i  
   Every developer should have his own build directory (usually somewhere in ```/home/$USER```)
4. [OBI](https://github.com/andreas-prouza/obi) runs the generated build from ```build-output/compile-list.json```
5. At the end [IBM i Build with OBI](https://github.com/andreas-prouza/ibm-i-build-obi) gets all logs and the report summary
